# Modules

FrostBar comes with a variety of modules that you can make use of. Each module
may be added any number of times to the bar with different configurations for
each.

Here is a list of all currently avaialable modules (as of 10/2/25):


```kdl
battery
cava
label
mpris
niri
time
```

## Common Configuration Options

There are a set of configurations that are common across (almost) all modules.

### Mouse Binds

This allows running commands when you interact with a widget with your mouse.
Options include:

```kdl
mouse-left
mouse-right
mouse-middle
scroll-up
scroll-down
scroll-left
scroll-right
```

After the mouse bind, you can specify the command to be run in 2 ways.

The first way will NOT run the command in a shell and requires separating
arguments in different string literals, like so:
```kdl
scroll-up "wpctl" "set-volume" "@DEFAULT_SINK@" "3%+"
```

The second way will run in a shell, allowing access to pipes and subshells.
```kdl
scroll-up sh=true "wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ 3%+ && echo hi"
```

### Container Style

This allows customizing the style of the container surrounding a widget. Options
include:


```kdl
style {
    text-color "#fff"
    background "#000"
    border {
        color "#fff"
        width 0.5
        radius 10.0
    }
}
```

Colors may be specified as described by the [Colors
Section](Introduction.md#colors).

#### text-color
Affects the color of text inside the widget.

#### background
Affects the background color of the widget.

#### border
Affects the border around the widget.

The border radius may also be specified per-corner like so:
```kdl
border {
    radius {
        top-left 10.0
        top-right 0.0
        bottom-left 0.0
        bottom-right 10.0
    }
}

```


## Module Specific Configuration Options

### Battery
```kdl
battery {
    icon-size 22
    charging-color "#73F5AB"
}
```

#### icon-size
Affects the size of the battery icon.

#### charging-color
Affects the color of the battery while plugged in. Use `text-color` in the
`style` section to affect the color while not plugged in.

### Cava
```kdl
cava {
    spacing 0.1
    dynamic-color true
    color "#fff"
}
```

#### spacing
Affects the spacing between bars in the audio visualizer, from 0.0 to 1.0.

#### dynamic-color
Whether or not to source colors from the currently-playing song's album art.
Defaults to true if not included.

#### color
if `dynamic-color` is enabled, affects the color of the bars when no album art
is available. Otherwise, affects the color of the bars at all times.

### Label
```kdl
label {
    text "text"
    size 22
    tooltip "tooltip
}
```

#### text
Text to be displayed by the label.

#### size
Size of the label text.

#### tooltip
Text that appears in a tooltip when hovering over the label.

### Mpris
The mpris module does not support the generic `style` or mouse binds settings.
If there is music playing, the album art will be displayed. If there is an audio
player where no album art is able to be retrieved (for example on Netflix), the
placeholder will be shown instead. `placeholder-style` has the same options as
the [Container Style](#container-style) section.

If multiple players are active at the same time, one album art will be shown for
each. Mouse binds can be specified to interact with individual players. Possible
actions for mouse binds include:

```kdl
"play"
"pause"
"play-pause"
"next"
"previous"
"stop"
// in milliseconds. Can be negative
"seek" 100
```

Here is an example config:
```kdl
mpris {
    mouse-left "play-pause"
    scroll-right "seek" 5000
    scroll-left "seek" -5000
    mouse-right "next"
    mouse-middle "stop"


    placeholder "Û∞ùö"
    placeholder-style {
        border {
            width 1.0
            color "#fff"
            radius 0.0
        }
    }
}
```



### Niri

```kdl
niri {
    spacing 10
    workspace-offset -1
}
```

#### spacing
Spacing between workspaces.

#### workspace-offset
Offset to apply to the index of each workspace. I use this with niri's
`empty-workspace-above-first` option to start labeling workspaces at 0.

### Time
```kdl
time {
    format "%H\n%M"
    tooltip-format "%a %b %-d\n%-m/%-d/%y"
}
```

#### format
Format string for displaying the time. See [the chrono
documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)
for information on format specifiers.

#### tooltip-format
Format string for displaying the tooltip. See [the chrono
documentation](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)
for information on format specifiers.
